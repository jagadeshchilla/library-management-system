create a library management with book recommendation system .System should have admin panel and student panel. Admin should have privilege to add students
Here’s a comprehensive design for a Library Management System with a Book Recommendation System that includes both an Admin Panel and a Student Panel.
System Overview
This system integrates traditional library management features (e.g., book borrowing, user management) with a personalized book recommendation engine. It has two main user roles:
•	Admin: Manages books, students, and library operations.
•	Student: Searches for books, borrows/returns books, and receives personalized recommendations.
Key Features
Admin Panel
1.	Student Management
•	Add, edit, or delete student records.
•	View student borrowing history and overdue fines.
2.	Book Management
•	Add, update, or remove books (ISBN, title, author, genre, etc.).
•	Track book availability and borrowing statistics.
3.	Reports and Analytics
•	View popular books and genres.
•	Monitor overdue books and fines.
•	Analyze library usage trends.
Student Panel
1.	Book Search
•	Search by title, author, genre, or ISBN.
•	Filter books by availability or rating.
2.	Borrow/Return Books
•	Borrow available books and track due dates.
•	Return borrowed books with fine calculations for overdue returns.
3.	Personalized Recommendations
•	Content-based recommendations using book metadata (e.g., genres, authors).
•	Collaborative filtering based on similar users’ preferences.
4.	Borrowing History
•	View past borrowed books and ratings.
Database Schema
1. Users Table
sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    role ENUM('admin', 'student'),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
2. Books Table
sql
CREATE TABLE Books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(255),
    genre VARCHAR(100),
    isbn VARCHAR(13) UNIQUE,
    num_copies INT DEFAULT 1,
    avg_rating FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
3. BorrowedBooks Table
sql
CREATE TABLE BorrowedBooks (
    borrow_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    book_id INT,
    borrow_date DATE,
    due_date DATE,
    return_date DATE NULL,
    fine FLOAT DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Books(book_id)
);
4. Ratings Table
sql
CREATE TABLE Ratings (
    rating_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    book_id INT,
    rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    review TEXT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Books(book_id)
);
Recommendation System Integration
The recommendation system can be integrated into the library management system using the dataset provided in the attached file or other datasets like Goodreads.
Implementation Steps:
1.	Use the dataset to train a recommendation model (e.g., collaborative filtering using user-book ratings).
2.	Store the model predictions in a database table for quick access:
sql
CREATE TABLE Recommendations (
    user_id INT,
    book_id INT,
    predicted_rating FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Books(book_id)
);
3.	Generate recommendations dynamically based on:
•	User preferences (e.g., genres of previously borrowed books).
•	Similar users' ratings (collaborative filtering).
Backend API Endpoints
Admin APIs
•	Add Student: POST /api/admin/students
•	Add Book: POST /api/admin/books
•	View Reports: GET /api/admin/reports
Student APIs
•	Search Books: GET /api/books?query=...
•	Borrow Book: POST /api/students/borrow
•	Return Book: POST /api/students/return
•	Get Recommendations: GET /api/students/recommendations
Frontend Design
Admin Panel
•	Dashboard with analytics (e.g., popular books, overdue fines).
•	Forms for adding/editing students and books.
•	Tables for viewing all students/books with search functionality.
Student Panel
•	Search bar for finding books.
•	Borrowed books section with due dates.
•	Recommendations displayed as a carousel or grid.
